This project is an attempt to control a Costco [Pre-Lit Radiant Micro LED Artificial Christmas Tree](https://www.costco.com/12'-pre-lit-radiant-micro-led-artificial-christmas-tree.product.100735151.html) with a Raspberry Pi, and ultimately with Siri via Homebridge.

The tree comes with a 433Mhz RF remote that controls dimming up/down, and a function button that cycles through different colors and modes.

I found this tutorial helpful for getting set up with 433Mhz on the pi:
